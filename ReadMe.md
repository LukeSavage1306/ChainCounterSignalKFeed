This code builds on the work of AKHombergers original design.  In its current format it:

* Provides a wireless remote windlass control based on a Wemos D1 Mini (ESP8266) with up/down/stop/chaincounter/counter reset functionality
* Provides chainlength to SignalK via a UDP connection
* Works with 12 and 24 volt systems
* Will track chainlength when the windlass is operated by existing controls or when allowed to "free fall"
